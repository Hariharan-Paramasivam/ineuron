    "#### 1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be\n",
    "\n",
    "integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",

    "            <td>a string is a value representing text always comes in between quotation quotes, double or single, (they mean the same, but canâ€™t be matched with each other) are used to create string literals, the quotes are there to indicate that the text that they enclose is not code, it is a value</td>\n",

    "#### 3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "List: the list is used for storing multiple data items in a single variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integer: integer can store only numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Float: float can store only floating values such as 233.33, 22.2, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do? \n",
    "\n",
    "Expression is made up of values, containers, and mathematical operators (operands) e.g \n",
    "\n",
    "     a = 2 + 3     and expressions are used to evaluate the values or represent the result on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "Expression is made up of values, containers, and mathematical operators (operands) and the statement is just like a command that a python interpreter executes like print.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",
    "\n",
    "bacon + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Sol: it gives <b>23</b> as execution code \n",

    "\n",
    "'spam' + 'spamspam'\n",
    "\n",
    "'spam' * 3\n",
    "\n",
    "sol: it will be the <b>same 'spamspamspam'</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: because we can't start giving variable an integer name. if we, we should begin with, a string-like alphabet name then integer. e100 or eggs100 is valid\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans: str(), int(), float()\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "\n",
    "'I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritos' \n",
    "\n",
    "sol:  because 99 is an integer it cannot be concatenated with strings, if we have to concatenate it we need to do typecasting."
